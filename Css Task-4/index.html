    <div>
        <p class="luffypara">
            Monkey D. Luffy is the main protagonist of the anime and manga series One Piece, created by Eiichiro Oda. He
            is a cheerful and fearless pirate with a dream of becoming the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure
            known as the "One Piece." Luffy ate the Gum-Gum Fruit (Gomu Gomu no Mi), which gave his body rubber-like
            properties, allowing him to stretch and perform powerful attacks. Despite his goofy and carefree nature,
            Luffy has a strong sense of justice and is fiercely loyal to his friends. He is the captain of the Straw Hat
            Pirates, a diverse and tight-knit crew that he formed during his journey across the seas. Luffy never gives
            up, no matter how strong his enemies are, and he often inspires others with his determination and heart.
            Over time, he has gained fame and respect from both allies and enemies across the world. His adventurous
            spirit and belief in freedom make him a true symbol of hope in the world of pirates.</p>
        <p class="luffypara">Luffy is known for his iconic straw hat, which was given to him by his idol, Red-Haired
            Shanks, and it symbolizes his promise to become a great pirate. He doesn't care about fame or wealth; his
            only goal is to live freely and protect the people he cares about. Luffy’s fighting style is unique due to
            his rubber body, and he constantly evolves by developing new powerful techniques like Gear Second, Gear
            Third, and Gear Fourth. As he travels through the Grand Line, he faces dangerous enemies, corrupt
            governments, and powerful warlords. Despite the challenges, he always stays true to his morals and never
            compromises his beliefs. Luffy treats his crew as family and would risk his life for any one of them without
            hesitation. His unwavering spirit, simplicity, and boldness have made him one of the most beloved characters
            in anime history. Luffy’s journey is a tale of courage, friendship, and the pursuit of dreams.</p>
